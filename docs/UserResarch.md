- Observation 1
  Observation Statetment: For our app name, our users were pretty split between the names of Eventure and LinkUp
  Supporting Data: Based off our survey, Eventure had 47.8% (11) of the votes and LinkUp had 43.5% of the votes (10)
  Team Action (if any): We are deciding on Eventure as it did have one more vote and as a group we thought it fit the app the best

- Observation 2
  Observation Statement: Instead of only having a calendar in our app we wanted to make it acessible for everyone and asked users if they would like to have our app link to their personal calenders.
  Supporting Data: In our survey we asked if users would like a feature where events are pushed into their calender. That feature recieved 4/5 stars with the majority being 5 stars.
  Team Action: We will create a feature that will allow users to RSVP to an event and push it to their calender(s).

- Observation 3
  Observation Statement: People often forget about events that are happening or that they agreed to go to. Many people want to be reminded a day or two in advance so they remember better.
  Supporting Data: Event reminds made up 26% of all responses for what they would want most in the app
  Team action: Create a reminder notification on planned events

- Observation 4
  Observation Statement: Paint point discovery - Information regarding to event planning in social circles gets scattered across different platforms or messages get buried in the group chat.
  Supporting Data: 20 survey responses describe scattered or buried info as a common problem in coordinating events.
  Team Action: Create a 'group chat' feature for an event on a user's calendar to easily access critical event info. Non-critical info in that chat will be filtered out.
